Here we list the various ways in which we computed weights from SVD scores and how we selected weighted quartets as input to wQMC.

For the following, k denotes the number of randomly sampled sites from each gene alignment. For each conversion scheme, we discarded quartets for which svd_max = 0. 
A) Only the quartet topology corresponding to the lowest SVD score was used. Its weight was R = (svd_med - svd_min)/(svd_max*exp(svd_max - svd_med))

B) Only the quartet topology corresponding to the lowest SVD score was used.
Weight(q_min) = 1 - svd_min

C) Only the quartet topology corresponding to the lowest SVD score was used.
Weight(q_min) = 1/exp(svd_min)

D) All quartet topologies were used. 
Weight(q_min) = (1 - svd_min)*R
Weight(q_med) = (1 - svd_med)*R
Weight(q_max) = (1 - svd_max)*R

E) All quartet topologies were used.
Weight(q_min) = (1 - svd_min)
Weight(q_med) = (1 - svd_med)
Weight(q_max) = (1 - svd_max)

F) All quartet topologies were used.
Weight(q_min) = (1/exp(svd_min))*R
Weight(q_med) = (1/exp(svd_med))*R
Weight(q_max) = (1/exp(svd_max))*R

G) All quartet topologies were used.
Weight(q_min) = (1/exp(svd_min))
Weight(q_med) = (1/exp(svd_med))
Weight(q_max) = (1/exp(svd_max))

H) Only the quartet topology corresponding to the lowest SVD score was used.
Weight(q_min) = A/exp(b*svd_min)
where A=10, b=1000

I) All quartet topologies were used.
Weight(q_min) = A/exp(b*svd_min)
Weight(q_med) = A/exp(b*svd_med)
Weight(q_max) = A/exp(b*svd_max)
where A=10, b=1000

J) All quartet topologies were used.
Weight(q_min) = -svd_min
Weight(q_med) = -svd_med
Weight(q_max) = -svd_max
